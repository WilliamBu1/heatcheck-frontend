          HeatCheck allows you to analyze a NBA player's recent performance in the right now! 
          We currently only support data from the top 3 players from each team. 
          This results in a total of 90 players in our system. 
          We also developed a Machine Learning model to assist in predicting how many 
          points a player will score in their next game!
